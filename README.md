Simple DL

This is a toolkit to create simple digital libraries, where the emphasis is
on ease of preservation, ease of rescue and ease of development.

The toolkit manages and generates a self-contained Web experience around a
collection of digital objects and their associated metadata.  

## Major features

* Metadata in ICA-AtoM or Dublin Core, created using spreadsheets (in CSV
format)
* doing away with databases and minimising the use of Web

applications - thus the entire user experince is a static site, with the
toolkit
